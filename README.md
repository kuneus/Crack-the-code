# Crack-the-code
This is a puzzle game called Crack The Code. It is my first personal project! 

Crack the Code is a simple game of deductive logic and a little bit of luck. Guess three numbers to unlock the code in as few attempts as possible and be sure to watch the clock, time is ticking! Play a few rounds and see your average attempts and time it takes to unlock each code. 

This project was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a currently ongoing project, with future versions to include the ability for users to change the number of codes and to upload, store, and display scores from online players.
